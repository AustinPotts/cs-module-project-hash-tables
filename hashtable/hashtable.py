# we have a function that takes that number & make sure it fits in our array, finds index spot (hash_index) aka SLOT

#Put: 
# Find the slot for the key 
# Search the linked list for the key
# if Found, update it
# if not Found, make a new hash table entry and add it to the list

# Find the slot for the key

# Q's to Study:
# What is a hash table load factor?
# how do you resize a hash table? why?
# How hash tables work in general? 
# What are we trying to solve with hash tables?
# How to use a cache with hash?

# A's 
# What are hash tables good at? They search fast, insert & delete fast. 
# Improving run time complexity 

# What are the sorts of things we can search for? When do we want to search for them quickly?
# Anything that can be hashed, we can use it to store & retireve the results of slow operations 
# not just searches but also functions that take long computation, you can use it as a cache 

# Think To Fix: Where am I doing a lot of calcualtion here, where I can save that calculation for future reference?

# Cache Implementation: Create Cache -> cache = {} , 
# Check if Cache is empty -> if n not in cache: cache[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
# After check the cache, we have the values in our cache so we can just -> return cache
